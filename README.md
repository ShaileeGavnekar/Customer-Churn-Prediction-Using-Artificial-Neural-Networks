This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow to predict bank customer churn. The dataset includes features like geography, credit score, age, and salary. Key steps involve encoding categorical data, splitting the dataset, and scaling features. The ANN has two hidden layers and is trained over 100 epochs, with model performance evaluated through a confusion matrix and test set predictions.
